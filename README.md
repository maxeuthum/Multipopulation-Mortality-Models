# Multipopulation-Mortality-Models

This github repository is linked to the master thesis $\textit{Multi-Population Mortality Models - A Comparison via a Socio-Economic Index of Deprivation on Italian Population}$ by Maximilian Euthum, submitted at TU Munich under supervision of Prof. Dr. Matthias Scherer, and further to the paper $\textit{A Neural Network approach for the mortality analysis of multiple populations: A case study on data of the Italian population
}$, published in cooperation with Prof. Dr. Matthias Scherer and Dr. Francesco Ungolo.

The aim is to provide the main structure of the implemented models, anonymizing data, but giving enough inside to allow for a reproduction of the results or application on own data.
The models were implemented in $\textit{R}$.
Most of the code lines are commented accordingly helping the reader and user to understand properly the different steps.
Note, the excel file which is stored in this repository is just an example of the structure of the used data.

However, if there are some issues or problems when implementing the given models, do not hesitate to come back to Maximilian Euthum, maximilian.euthum@outlook.com.
